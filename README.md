	LDAP Injection
Description 	
LDAP Injection may be possible. It may be possible for an attacker to bypass authentication controls, and to view and modify arbitrary data in the LDAP directory.
URL 	http://142.202.242.172/TQUIA729JAULAMJS/login.php?key=EWREWTRUTHEWUFIUEWJFEWJFWEIUFHE324325473524632EFJWIFJWOJFIEWJOFJOWEFYEWFYUWEUFTUYEWTFUYEWTFUYEWOWEKPFOPWEPFKW
Method 	POST
Parameter 	password
Attack 	Equivalent LDAP expression: [\' UNION SELECT IF(YOUR-CONDITION-HERE,(SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables),\'a\') -- -)(objectClass=*]. Random parameter: [p1znp6wofqs4vmgkdzob037dwmdnpaovyv3zcpy7o9xf829jwq90wooa3789bdsugi4tptljm7y2pfxq34kv4exmqusopkl92uwo6].
Evidence

Request Header - size: 1,061 bytes. 	
Request Body - size: 208 bytes. 	
Response Header - size: 252 bytes. 	
Response Body - size: 0 bytes. 	
Instances 	1
Solution 	
Validate and/or escape all user input before using it to create an LDAP query. In particular, the following characters (or combinations) should be deny listed:

&

|

!

<

>

=

~=

>=

<=

*

(

)

,

+

-

"

'

;

\

/

NUL character
